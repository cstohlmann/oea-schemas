# Student Portrait Solution
[Student Portrait](https://www.analytikus.com/learning-analytics) by [Analytikus](https://www.analytikus.com/) is an analytical solution that uses artificial intelligence to get to know all students and support them through personalized messaging. It identifies key student variables and characteristics, then nudges them through short, concise messages, that are personalized and engaging, in a timely manner to maximize student success. 

With the Student Portrait solution, educational institutions can understand how students learn in order to maximize their performance, satisfaction and motivation by delivering personalized nudges through a virtual pedagogical bot. It ensures the best outcomes for students with a 360-degree view of activities and engagement, followed by the provisioning of the right services and support at the optimal time.

Portrait is operationalized through two AI agents: Emilia, a learning therapist, and Max, an organizational assistant, and uses data from multiple sources including LMS (Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, etc), SIS, Microsoft Teams, Reflect, etc.

## Data Schema
The Student Portrait data schema has 24 data entities. The Data Entities table below provides the description and update frequency of each data entity.

We are working toward aligning data sources/OEA modules like Canvas and Moodle to the Student Portrait schema, and this will include the creation of the technical assets (notebooks, pipelines, etc) to facilitate this. Please check this folder in a few weeks for updates to the Student Portrait schema.
